There are tests for each major component of the core language. These are organised into a number of folders:

Path       | Description
---------- | -----------
`mock/`    | Interfaces for creating mock versions of core language components like the lexer or bytecode parser
`parser/`  | Tests for the bytecode parser
`runtime/` | Runtime language tests, containing both passing and failing test cases
